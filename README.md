=========

Semantic grid system using margins

##KNOWN ISSUES
- gutter needs to be percentage based
- grid containers that don't fit full-width don't clear grid containers below them. May need "clear: both" on grid containers.


##TODO
- test further
- add bottom margin to grid-container?
- move margin-bottom to grid-container instead of removing from last-child?
- how to reset $columns on the next grid-container if it's been redefined
- change names of nested boxes/classes to be clearer
